# Contributions

Most of the project was developed using VS Code live share in one of the group member's machines. This way commit history does not reflect individual code contributions for project, in fact, for most of the features after phase 1, we all worked together on the same code. All and all, it is fair to assign the following to each task member

## Marcelo

- Update and insert operations

- As the more experienced in Django, general program flow and troubleshooting of django specific features and modules

## Lucas

- Logic for querrying the database on time management features

- Project timeline planning

## Gabriel

- Project technical planning and task delegation

- Quality assurance and bug fixing

- Delete operations

- Bootstrap and general look of the website
